TODO




3. Creating data loader for the insects dataset

4. Creating concept drift functions for the image datasets
 - different types of drifts
 - asysnchronous
 - spatial variability -- all the clients
 					   -- only a part of the clients

5. Clustering mechanism for the existing clients among the exising multiple servers 
- (without overlapping?)
- fomulate the solution 
- program



7. Implement other state of the art aggregator functions

8. All the servers and clients are instantiated with the same NN-model, independantly. That is changing the model for the server, does not make the model of the clients to adapt to that change and vice versa. This might me a problem when model heterogeneity of clients and server might have to be accounted for in teh future.

9. creating the main federated learning iteration rounds functionality





DONE

2. Debug existing functions and commit

6. Create evaluation functions for caculating the loss and accuracies
6.1 for the clients
6.2 for the servers

1. Plotting functions
- client's accuracies should be tested
- server 

10. Progress bar of the training
