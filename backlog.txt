TODO




3. Creating data loader for the insects dataset

4. Creating concept drift functions for the image datasets
 4.2. uncontrolled (more random and realistic)

5. Clustering mechanism for the existing clients among the exising multiple servers 
- (without overlapping?)
- fomulate the solution 
- program



7. Implement other state of the art aggregator functions

8. All the servers and clients are instantiated with the same NN-model, independantly. That is changing the model for the server, does not make the model of the clients to adapt to that change and vice versa. This might me a problem when model heterogeneity of clients and server might have to be accounted for in teh future.

11. data heteogeneity: two dataset for the clients considering spatiality and temporality

12. Test model accuracies

13. Run initial test with drift

14. plot besidet the graph std deviation 






DONE

2. Debug existing functions and commit

6. Create evaluation functions for caculating the loss and accuracies
6.1 for the clients
6.2 for the servers

1. Plotting functions
- client's accuracies should be tested
- server 

10. Progress bar of the training

9. creating the main federated learning iteration rounds functionality

4. Creating concept drift functions for the image datasets
 4.1. controlled drift
